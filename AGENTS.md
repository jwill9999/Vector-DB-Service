# Repository Guidelines

This repository keeps the canonical contributor guide at `docs/guides/contributors/AGENTS.md`. Please consult that file for full onboarding, coding standards, and review expectations.

Quick access:
- [Contributor Guide](docs/guides/contributors/AGENTS.md)
- [Documentation Index](docs/index/README.md)

Keep this root file in place for tools that expect `AGENTS.md` at the repository root.
